Structure of To Do App:
A "ToDo" is pretty much just a list of tasks that need to be done. A To Do is completeable as you can have many To Do lists with related tasks
	- You can add, delete, and complete Tasks in a To Do list. You can also complete the To Do list which completes all Tasks

A Task is, well, a task. 
	- A Task needs a name, but a description is optional
	- A Task is completeable
	- You can update the description and due date on a Task

A Dueable Task (yes Jeff, I stole that pun) is a Task that has a due date
	- A dueable task has a due date and can be overdue
	

If making this a whole service app again, should make models/request classes?
I feel like I'm missing something or this isn't robust enough. Maybe I'm just a simple guy who needs a simple To Do app
